# Pagerank-Algorithm

Implementation of the PageRank algorithm using the Matrix method and the Power method formulation.

# Networks
Networks are an abstraction of the real world that focuses on the objects represented as nodes and the interaction between several objects. We live in an intertwined world where information and entities are connected to each other. Hence, networks are ubiquitous. Some examples include the World Wide Web, social networks, biological networks, transportation networks, epidemic networks and so on

This project focuses on the Page Rank centrality. The network of importance is the web page network. Search engines are huge power factors on the Web that guide people to information and services. One of the most successful search engine is Google due to it's accurate search results. PageRank is the dominant algorithm used by Google that serves as a key to the accurate ranking. 

The PageRank algorithm in essence decides how important a specific page is and therefore how high it will show up in a search result. The associated algorithm is very powerful as it is able to rank billions of nodes in a reasonable number of computational steps. The idea that governs PageRank is that a page is important when other important pages link to it. Keeping this in mind, we calculate the ranking of the wikipedia pages.
